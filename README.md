## Eleven-Note-Xamarin

**Description:** The Eleven Note web application project was completed in class during the 301 portion of the course, which was led by Auri Rahimzadeh.  Users can create an account and then use the app to take notes. Since it is a CRUD app, the user can create, read, update, and delete their notes.  This version of Eleven Note includes a mobile app componenet, which was built out in Xamarin.
